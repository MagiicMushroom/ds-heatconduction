# ds-heatconduction
A thing I found and edited. 

A clone of https://github.com/rickfu415/heatConduction, patched to be compatible with the latest versions of numpy and also with some custom features added. 

To use, download all files, install numpy pandas matplotlib and jupyterlab, open solver.ipynb, edit parameters.py, and see some magic.
